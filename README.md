# Frankenstein Survivor
Oh no! Frank is in trouble! Will the misunderstood monster survive the anger of a pitchfork-and-torch-wielding mob?

This is a simple 'vampire survivors' style game created using [DragonRuby](https://dragonruby.itch.io/dragonruby-gtk), as an experiment in [flow field pathfinding](https://medium.com/codex/goal-based-vector-field-pathfinding-flow-field-b467677f7fa5).

The game builds for windows/linux/mac can be downloaded from [itch.io](https://luolamies.itch.io/frankenstein-survivor).

Happy Halloween 2024! ðŸŽƒ
